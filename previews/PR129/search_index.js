(2019)[Diego2019].\n\nDescription\n\nThe transfer operator P^Nis computed as an N-by-N matrix of transition  probabilities between the states defined by the partition elements, where N is the  number of boxes in the partition that is visited by the orbit/points. \n\nIf  x_t^(D) _n=1^L are the L different D-dimensional points over  which the transfer operator is approximated,  C_k=1^N  are the N different  partition elements (as dictated by ϵ) that gets visited by the points, and  phi(x_t) = x_t+1, then\n\nP_ij = dfrac\n x_n  phi(x_n) in C_j cap x_n in C_i \n x_m  x_m in C_i \n\nwhere  denotes the cardinal. The element P_ij thus indicates how many points  that are initially in box C_i end up in box C_j when the points in C_i are  projected one step forward in time. Thus, the row P_ik^N where  k in 1 2 ldots N  gives the probability  of jumping from the state defined by box C_i to any of the other N states. It  follows that sum_k=1^N P_ik = 1 for all i. Thus, P^N is a row/right  stochastic matrix.\n\nInvariant measure estimation from transfer operator\n\nThe left invariant distribution mathbfrho^N is a row vector, where  mathbfrho^N P^N = mathbfrho^N. Hence, mathbfrho^N is a row  eigenvector of the transfer matrix P^N associated with eigenvalue 1. The distribution  mathbfrho^N approximates the invariant density of the system subject to the  partition ϵ, and can be taken as a probability distribution over the partition elements.\n\nIn practice, the invariant measure mathbfrho^N is computed using  invariantmeasure, which also approximates the transfer matrix. The invariant distribution is initialized as a length-N random distribution which is then applied to P^N.  The resulting length-N distribution is then applied to P^N again. This process  repeats until the difference between the distributions over consecutive iterations is  below some threshold. \n\nProbability and entropy estimation\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator{RectangularBinning}) estimates    probabilities for the bins defined by the provided binning (est.ϵ)\ngenentropy(x::AbstractDataset, est::TransferOperator{RectangularBinning}) does the same,    but computes generalized entropy using the probabilities.\n\nSee also: RectangularBinning, invariantmeasure.\n\n[Diego2019]: Diego, D., Haaga, K.

If two elements are equal, the default behaviour is to randomly assign one of them as the largest (lt = Entropies.isless_rand).

See   description below for explanation of the weighting parameter A. This implementation   is based on Azami & Escudero (2016) [Azami2016].\n\nProbability estimation\n\nUnivariate time series\n\nTo estimate probabilities or entropies from univariate time series, use the following methods:\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractVector, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator). Constructs state vectors   from x using embedding lag τ and embedding dimension m, symbolizes state vectors,   and computes probabilities as (weighted) relative frequency of symbols.\ngenentropy(x::AbstractVector, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator; α=1, base = 2) computes   probabilities by calling probabilities(x::AbstractVector, est),   then computer the order-α generalized entropy to the given base.\n\nSpeeding up repeated computations\n\nA pre-allocated integer symbol array s can be provided to save some memory allocations if the probabilities are to be computed for multiple data sets.\n\nNote: it is not the array that will hold the final probabilities that is pre-allocated, but the temporary integer array containing the symbolized data points. Thus, if provided, it is required that length(x) == length(s) if x is a Dataset, or length(s) == length(x) - (m-1)τ if x is a univariate signal that is to be embedded first.\n\nUse the following signatures (only works for SymbolicPermutation).\n\nprobabilities!(s::Vector{Int}, x::AbstractVector, est::SymbolicPermutation) → ps::Probabilities\nprobabilities!(s::Vector{Int}, x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicPermutation) → ps::Probabilities\n\nMultivariate datasets\n\nAlthough not dealt with in the original paper describing the estimators, numerically speaking, permutation entropies can also be computed for multivariate datasets with dimension ≥ 2 (but see caveat below). Such datasets may be, for example, preembedded time series. Then, just skip the delay reconstruction step, compute and symbols directly from the L existing state vectors mathbfx_1 mathbfx_2 ldots mathbfx_L.\n\nprobabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator). Compute ordinal patterns of the   state vectors of x directly (without doing any embedding), symbolize those patterns,   and compute probabilities as (weighted) relative frequencies of symbols.\ngenentropy(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator). Computes probabilities from   symbol frequencies using probabilities(x::AbstractDataset, est::SymbolicProbabilityEstimator),   then computes the order-α generalized (permutation) entropy to the given base.\n\nCaveat: A dynamical interpretation of the permutation entropy does not necessarily hold if computing it on generic multivariate datasets. Method signatures for Datasets are provided for convenience, and should only be applied if you understand the relation between your input data, the numerical value for the permutation entropy, and its interpretation.\n\nDescription\n\nAll symbolic estimators use the same underlying approach to estimating probabilities.\n\nEmbedding, ordinal patterns and symbolization\n\nConsider the n-element univariate time series x(t) = x_1 x_2 ldots x_n. Let mathbfx_i^m tau = x_j x_j+tau ldots x_j+(m-1)tau for j = 1 2 ldots n - (m-1)tau be the i-th state vector in a delay reconstruction with embedding dimension m and reconstruction lag tau. There are then N = n - (m-1)tau state vectors.\n\nFor an m-dimensional vector, there are m possible ways of sorting it in ascending order of magnitude. Each such possible sorting ordering is called a motif. Let pi_i^m tau denote the motif associated with the m-dimensional state vector mathbfx_i^m tau, and let R be the number of distinct motifs that can be constructed from the N state vectors. Then there are at most R motifs; R = N precisely when all motifs are unique, and R = 1 when all motifs are the same.\n\nEach unique motif pi_i^m tau can be mapped to a unique integer symbol 0 leq s_i leq M-1. Let S(pi)  mathbbR^m to mathbbN_0 be the function that maps the motif pi to its symbol s, and let Pi denote the set of symbols Pi =  s_i _iin  1 ldots R.\n\nProbability computation\n\nSymbolicPermutation\n\nThe probability of a given motif is its frequency of occurrence, normalized by the total number of motifs (with notation from [Fadlallah2013]),\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) sum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left(mathbfx_k^m tau right) N\n\nwhere the function mathbf1_A(u) is the indicator function of a set A. That     is, mathbf1_A(u) = 1 if u in A, and mathbf1_A(u) = 0 otherwise.\n\nSymbolicAmplitudeAwarePermutation\n\nAmplitude-aware permutation entropy is computed analogously to regular permutation entropy but probabilities are weighted by amplitude information as follows.\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  a_ksum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi left( mathbfx_k^m tau right) a_k = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i left( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  a_ksum_k=1^N a_k\n\nThe weights encoding amplitude information about state vector mathbfx_i = (x_1^i x_2^i ldots x_m^i) are\n\na_i = dfracAm sum_k=1^m x_k^i  + dfrac1-Ad-1 sum_k=2^d x_k^i - x_k-1^i\n\nwith 0 leq A leq 1. When A=0 , only internal differences between the elements of mathbfx_i are weighted. Only mean amplitude of the state vector elements are weighted when A=1. With, 0A1, a combined weighting is used.\n\nSymbolicWeightedPermutation\n\nWeighted permutation entropy is also computed analogously to regular permutation entropy, but adds weights that encode amplitude information too:\n\np(pi_i^m tau) = dfracsum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) = s_i\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right)\n w_ksum_k=1^N mathbf1_uS(u) in Pi\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right) w_k = dfracsum_k=1^N\nmathbf1_uS(u) = s_i\nleft( mathbfx_k^m tau right)  w_ksum_k=1^N w_k\n\nThe weighted permutation entropy is equivalent to regular permutation entropy when weights are positive and identical (w_j = beta  forall  j leq N and beta  0). Weights are dictated by the variance of the state vectors.\n\nLet the aritmetic mean of state vector mathbfx_i be denoted by\n\nmathbfhatx_j^m tau = frac1m sum_k=1^m x_j + (k+1)tau\n\nWeights are then computed as\n\nw_j = dfrac1msum_k=1^m (x_j+(k+1)tau - mathbfhatx_j^m tau)^2\n\nNote: in equation 7, section III, of the original paper, the authors write\n\nw_j = dfrac1msum_k=1^m (x_j-(k-1)tau - mathbfhatx_j^m tau)^2\n\nBut given the formula they give for the arithmetic mean, this is not the variance of mathbfx_i, because the indices are mixed: x_j+(k-1)tau in the weights formula, vs. x_j+(k+1)tau in the arithmetic mean formula. This seems to imply that amplitude information about previous delay vectors are mixed with mean amplitude information about current vectors. The authors also mix the terms \"vector\" and \"neighboring vector\" (but uses the same notation for both), making it hard to interpret whether the sign switch is a typo or intended. Here, we use the notation above, which actually computes the variance for mathbfx_i.\n\nEntropy computation\n\nThe generalized order-α Renyi entropy[Rényi1960] can be computed over the probability distribution of symbols as H(m tau alpha) = dfracalpha1-alpha log left( sum_j=1^R p_j^alpha right). Permutation entropy, as described in Bandt and Pompe (2002), is just the limiting case as α to1, that is H(m tau) = - sum_j^R p(pi_j^m tau) ln p(pi_j^m tau).\n\nNote: Do not confuse the order of the generalized entropy (α) with the order m of the permutation entropy (which controls the symbol size). Permutation entropy is usually estimated with α = 1, but the implementation here allows the generalized entropy of any dimension to be computed from the symbol frequency distribution.\n\n[BandtPompe2002]: Bandt, Christoph, and Bernd Pompe. \"Permutation entropy: a natural complexity measure for time series.\" Physical review letters 88.17 (2002): 174102.\n\n[Berger2019]: Berger, Sebastian, et al. \"Teaching Ordinal Patterns to a Computer: Efficient Encoding Algorithms Based on the Lehmer Code.\" Entropy 21.10 (2019): 1023.\n\n[Fadlallah2013]: Fadlallah, Bilal, et al. \"Weighted-permutation entropy: A complexity measure for time series incorporating amplitude information.\" Physical Review E 87.2 (2013): 022911.\n\n[Rényi1960]: A.
